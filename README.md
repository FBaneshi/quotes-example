# quotes-example
A repository example used in the 4th Phd exchange workshop 2024-11-25

As a final mini-homework, and in order to obtain your participation certificate, all students taking part in the workshop are requested to submit a pull request to this repository, adding a quote of their liking to the file `quotes.md`.

You can use whatever means you like to create such pull request, but the adviced workflow is as follows (check the workshop slides for more info):
1. Clone the repository to your local computer using VScode and your GitHub user.
2. Edit the `quotes.md` file, adding your own quote (any quote that you like will do).
3. Create a new commit from VSCode, adding a commit message.
4. Create and submit a pull request to the remote repository in GitHub, using your GitHub account (make sure your account has your name or your email, this is important so we can check who is who).
5. We will accept the pull request and merge

The deadline for this homework is on 2024-12-03. The repository will remain open until then, then we will switch it to private. We will add your user accounts to uc3m-aerospace afterward so you can continue to have access to it and the rest of repositories in this organization.
